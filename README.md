# Heart-Attack-in-Youth-vs.-Adults-in-Nigeria-Power-BI-Analysis

## Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with increasing prevalence in Nigeria due to changing lifestyles, urbanization, and socioeconomic factors. Understanding the distribution of heart attack cases among different demographics, as well as the key risk factors, is crucial for effective public health interventions. This study analyzes heart attack cases among youth and adults in Nigeria, with a focus on the impact of lifestyle choices, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions

## Objectives  
1. **Which demographic groups are most vulnerable to heart attacks in Nigeria?**  
2. **What factors most significantly correlate with severe heart attacks?**  
3. **Which age groups are most affected across different states in Nigeria?**  
4. **How do socioeconomic factors (income, employment) influence heart attack outcomes?**  
5. **What role does diet type play in heart attack frequency and severity?** 


## Goal
The primary objective of this study is to analyze the prevalence of heart attacks in Nigeria across different age groups, genders, and locations. Additionally, the study aims to identify the most significant contributing factors to severe heart attacks, assess the impact of socioeconomic factors, and examine the role of lifestyle choices such as diet, smoking, and exercise. By deriving key insights, this analysis will provide data-driven recommendations for preventive healthcare measures.


## Dataset Overview
**Source:**
 Kaggle ([Heart Attack in Youth vs. Adults in Nigeria](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/heart-attack-in-youth-vs-adult-in-nigeria))
   
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 898,796 records of heart attack cases across different states in Nigeria. The key columns analyzed include:
- State (Location of the patient)
- Age Group (Youth vs. Adults)
- Gender (Male/Female)
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Smoking Status (Smoker/Non-smoker)
- Exercise Frequency (Low/Moderate/High)
- Diabetes (Yes/No)
- Cholesterol Level (Normal/High)
- Family History (Yes/No)
- Stress Levels (Low/Moderate/High)
- Diet Type (Healthy/Unhealthy)
- Heart Attack Severity (Mild/Moderate/Severe)
- Hospitalized (Yes/No)
- Income Level (Low/Medium/High)
- Urban or Rural (Residence location)
- Employment Status (Employed/Unemployed)

  ## Data Preparation  
- Loaded the dataset into **Power BI**  
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent values  
- Standardized column names for easier analysis


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Created measures & calculated fields for KPI tracking.
- Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations.
- Identified correlations between heart attack severity and different factors.
- Created **Power BI visualizations** to explore trends  
- Used **filters and slicers** for demographic breakdowns  
- Identified correlations between lifestyle choices and heart attack severity  


## Key Insights
- Heart attacks are slightly more prevalent in urban areas (449.7k cases) compared to rural areas (449.1k cases).
- 50.08% of heart attack cases were in smokers, highlighting smoking as a major risk factor.
- Hypertension (449k cases) and diabetes (450k cases) are strongly correlated with severe heart attacks.
- Heart disease isn’t just an “old age” issue – 50.08% of cases were in youths (<40 years), almost equal to adults (49.92%).
- Diet plays a role – 100,183 patients reported unhealthy eating habits, showing a link between nutrition and heart disease.


##  Power BI Dashboard Overview  
The **interactive Power BI dashboard** includes:  
- **Demographic breakdowns** (Age, Gender, Location)  
- **Health risk analysis** (Smoking, Diabetes, Hypertension)  
- **Socioeconomic impact** (Income, Employment, Urban vs. Rural)  
- **Dietary and lifestyle trends**


## Recommendations
1.	Public health campaigns targeting urban populations to reduce stress-related risks and unhealthy lifestyle habits.
2.	Stronger anti-smoking regulations and awareness programs to address a major contributor to heart attacks.
3.	Early screening for hypertension and diabetes to prevent severe cases.
4.	Youth-targeted awareness programs since younger populations are at high risk.
5.	Nutritional education programs to promote healthy eating habits and reduce diet-related risks.
6.	Improved access to healthcare and lifestyle modification programs to help those with genetic predisposition manage their risks.

## Conclusion  
This project highlights the **critical need for heart health awareness in Nigeria**. By leveraging **data analytics**, we can drive better healthcare decisions and improve public health outcomes.
